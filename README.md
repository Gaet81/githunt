> Firefox extension - Open new tab with trending github repositories when clicking the addon icon

Whenever you will click on the addon icon, it will open a new tab, you will be presented with a page similar to following

![New Tab](http://i.imgur.com/COyJUJg.png)

By default it is set to show the trending repositories from the current week plus the repositories belonging to every language is shown. However, once you will apply some filter, it will remember your configuration and the next time you will open the new tab, you will be presented with the last filter that you applied.

## Installation

Extension itself doesn't need any setup. All you have to do is

TBC - Addon has not yet been validated


- Voila! You are all set to go on a hunt.

## Contribution
I'd want to thanks [Kamran Ahmed](https://kamranahmed.info) for the creation of the addon, I just adapt it to make it work in Firefox rather than Chrome.
